# **Reports Screen**
The ‘Report Screen’ allows users to generate a set of standard reports associating with production values. The screen provides a preview of the current selected report before finalized generation. Users can select between report templates in the top left corner, along with start and end dates. Additional filters for report columns can be changed in the report heading.

Any changes made to the date range or column filters will require users to refresh the report. Users can download or print the report from the respective bottom right selections.

On the report screen users can change the export file type for the respective report. Users can change the export type via the top left drop-down menu. Users can choose between PDF, CSV, and Excel. By default, the selection is set to PDF. Users can click ‘Export’ to download the respective report in the selected file type.
