_Note: The Central Facility Screen is not affected by global filters._

The ‘Central Facility View’ acts as an alternative view for central facilities due to the equipment amount. This screen shares some functionality with the Production Detail Screen, allowing users to view site-specific details. The Central Facility view is populated with dynamic equipment cards organized by run. Certain functionalities of the Production Detail Screen are carried over into the Central Facility View. Feature such as Demand Poll, Polling Frequency, VO Tickets, and Event History are located in the top right corner of the screen. For more information about these features, refer to the Production Detail Screen documentation.
