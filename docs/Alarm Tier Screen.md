# **Alarm Tier Screen**
The ‘Alarm Tier’ Screen allows users to modify alarm information associated to specific tier definitions. Definitions are provided for each tier and are unique to each area. Each tier has 3 modes for edits: (1) Setpoints, (2) Priority, and (3) Process. An asset and area must be selected to generate the alarm tiers.

Users can modify the alarm setpoints on this screen for each general tag provided. The ‘pen’ icon in the tier header must be selected to make view and make changes to tag setpoints. To edit a value, double click on the respective value box.

When ‘Process’ is selected, users can change how alarms are reported for each tag. These selections reflect in email notifications, VOReports, or a combination of both. As with Setpoints and Priority, users can double click a value to change its current setting.
