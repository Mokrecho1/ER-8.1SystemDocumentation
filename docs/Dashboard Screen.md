# **Dashboard Screen**

The dashboard acts as the landing page for users. The screen serves as a centralized and customizable hub where users can quickly assess critical information without needing to navigate to different screens. The dashboard screen incorporates a flexible widget system that allows users to customize their visual experience according to their workflow requirements. This system allows users to resize, move, remove, and add various widgets. Unlike other screens, the dashboard is not impacted by any filter selections made by the user. This ensures that users always have access to a consistent set of information regardless of adjustments or prior selections.

## **Dashboard Access**
Users can access and view dashboards created by other operators. The dropdown menu in the top left allows users to view and select possible dashboards. Dashboards available to view are identified by the operator’s Ignition username.

The selection system allows users to copy other dashboard layouts to their own dashboard. If a layout is copied over, the dashboard selection will reset to the user’s dashboard (‘My Dashboard’).

*Note: Layout copying overwrites all widget placements, sizing, and information and CANNOT be reverted.*

## **Widget System**

The widget system offers a flexible way to customize the dashboard layout and content. Users can access the widget management system through the top right toggle to tailor their dashboards according to preferences and needs. To access the widget system users can click the toggle to ‘Move/Resize’.

## **Edit Mode**
When entering edit mode, a grid overlays the dashboard, indicating potential locations for widget placement. Each square within the grid presents an opportunity to add a widget. By clicking on any square within the grid, a widget list appears, indicating available options. Visual cues such as greying of the box and a plus sign highlight areas where widgets can be added. Once a widget is selected and added, the user can freely move, resize, or delete it to suit preferences and optimize the dashboard's layout. Widgets dynamically scale to accommodate changes in layout and content, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. Widget configurations are not available in edit mode.
