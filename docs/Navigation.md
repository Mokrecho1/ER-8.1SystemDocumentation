Users can navigate within the EXCO system via the left side navigation bar. To navigate to different screens, users can click on the respective screen button within the bar. If users are unsure which button navigates to which screen, hovering the mouse over the button will provide a navigation description. Users can identify which screen they are currently using via the button that is highlighted green.
