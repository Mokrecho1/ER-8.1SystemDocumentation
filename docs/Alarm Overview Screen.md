# **Alarm Overview Screen**
The ‘Alarm Overview Screen’ allows operators to view active alarms within the EXCO system. This screen integrates additional filtering that allows users to view specific alarm types depending on their selection. Alarming on this screen is NOT related to filter selections made in the header, but rather from field selection boxes at the top of the screen. The alarm overview screen is broken into two tabs: (1) Alarm Status, and (2) Alarm Journal.

## **Alarm Status**
The ‘Alarm Status’ tab provides users the ability to view all alarms within the system. Visible alarms are based on filter selections made in this tab. Users can change the current filter options by clicking on the ‘filter’ icon in the top right. Users can search for specific alarms using the search bar. The search bar appears once a user clicks on the search icon in the top right. Column settings for alarm status are customizable. Users can enable or disable column visibility in the setting pop up via the gear icon.

The ‘Alarm Status’ tab has sub-tabs for ‘Active’ and ‘Shelved’ alarms. Users can identify the number of active alarms in the top left corner of the alarm status tab. The number of active alarms and shelved alarms act as the headers for the sub-tabs.

Users can acknowledge or shelve alarms by selecting the alarm from the list and clicking on the respective action in the bottom right corner. Acknowledging or shelving alarms will write the action to the ‘Alarm Journal’.

## **Alarm Journal**
The ‘Alarm Journal’ tab provides a log of alarm actions taken by users. The ‘Alarm Journal’ tab maintains all search, filter, and configuration capabilities as the alarm status tab.
