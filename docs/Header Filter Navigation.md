# Header Filter Navigation
The EXCO system maintains a dynamic filtering header that influences screen information. Users can identify a specific asset, area, and site to find information. Selected filters automatically apply to the screen.

Users can leverage the filters to drill down to more specific data or use specific data to find its associated overarching information. For example, if a user selects the site ‘ALLEE 1H’, the area and asset filter options will automatically populate with the associated information.

If users seek additional filter options, the header allows two (2) additional custom filter options. Custom filter choices are a list of additional metadata properties. Adding a custom filter populates the filter navigation with the respective dropdown option. Users can remove custom filters by clicking on the associated (X) or clicking on ‘Clear Filters’.

The filter system allows users to navigate through filter choices without having to reset the filter. The ‘Previous / Next’ buttons allow users to scroll through the **lowest** filter selection. For example, if the user has filtered down to a specific ‘Area’, clicking the left or right arrow will change the filter to the next or previous ‘Area’. If users have a ‘Site’ selected, clicking the arrows will only navigate to the previous or next site and will not impact ‘Area’ or ‘Asset’ choice.
