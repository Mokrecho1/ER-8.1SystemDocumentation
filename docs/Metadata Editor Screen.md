# **Metadata Editor Screen**
The ‘Metadata Editor’ screen is a front-end metadata editor, allowing users to create/edit metadata for sites within the EXCO ecosystem. The metadata editor screen is divided between two tabs: (1) Completed, and (2) In-Progress. 

## **Completed Tab**
Users will default to the ‘Completed’ tab when navigating to the Metadata Editor screen. The ‘Completed’ tab houses a list of all sites that are active and have all required metadata. Selecting an entry on this list will populate the bottom ‘Edit’ pane with all respective information. Selecting an entry does NOT enable edit mode. Edit mode is enabled via the center ‘pen’ icon next to ‘Edit Mode’.

## **In Progress**
The ‘In-Progress’ tab can be accessed via the top left of the Metadata Editor Screen. This tab houses a list of all sites that are currently in progress when it comes to metadata entry. New sites can be added via the ‘Add’ button next to ‘Add Mode’ in the center of the screen. When selected, users will have the ability to add metadata for a new site. The Edit/Add pane at the bottom of the screen holds fields for all metadata, both required and not required. Required metadata is indicated with a red asterisk. If users partially complete a site addition and submit the site, it will populate into the ‘In Progress’ list until all required metadata entries have been filled. Users can quickly identify how many metadata entries are missing for each in progress site via the ‘Progress’ column.

## **Equipment**
The ‘Add Equipment’ button allows users to add equipment cards to screen depending on their use case. Clicking the ‘Add Equipment’ button will open a swing dock. Users can select a site entry before clicking the ‘Add Equipment' button or select a specific site on the dock.

The ‘Add Equipment’ dock includes site selection, device selection, and a list of equipment times that can added or removed. Users can mass replicate cards displayed from other sites by checking the ‘Copy From’ box in the top right and then selecting an existing site from the dropdown below. Adding a specific card requires users to select the ‘check box’ next to each equipment entry. Any added cards can be updated by changed the respective value boxes.

The bottom table provides a list of all equipment cards for that site. The table will highlight newly added equipment as green and removed or modified equipment as yellow. Users will need to click ‘Submit’ at the bottom of the dock to finalize changes.
