## **Comms Overview Screen**
The ‘Comms Overview Screen’ provides users the ability to monitor communication devices. The screen consists of a singular table that is dynamically impacted by the header filter selection. Users can view the name, voltage, status, last poll, and last poll attempt to diagnose errors or analyze communication devices. Tag paths for communication devices display as a tooltip once the user hovers their mouse over the device entry.
