# **User Settings**
User settings are accessible on any screen within the EXCO system. Users can click on the ‘gear icon’ in the top right of the system to access the settings dock. The user settings dock provides the user customization options to standardize their experience in the EXCO system. When the user settings dock is opened the user can identify they are correctly logged in via the display name and date. Users can log out of the EXCO system from the user settings dock if needed.
User customization ranges between default filters and default columns. Users can select a default ‘Asset’ and/or ‘Area’. This will automatically apply those selections into the header filter for the user when users access the system. The ‘Site Overview Column Selection’ and ‘Equipment Overview Column Selection’ allows users to establish columns for ‘Site Overview’ and ‘Equipment Overview’ screens.
